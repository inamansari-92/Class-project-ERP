# 📦 A.T COMMODITIES ERP SYSTEM

## 📝 Project Overview
This ERP system was developed as a class project to streamline core business operations for A.T COMMODITIES. It focuses on automating invoice generation, delivery tracking, and staff attendance management. The application is built using Python and designed for local execution, with future plans for cloud deployment and AI integration.

## 🚀 Features
- **Invoice Generation**: Quickly create and manage client invoices.
- **Delivery Ledger**: Record and track daily deliveries with timestamps.
- **Attendance Management**: Log staff attendance efficiently.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple CLI-based interaction for ease of use.
- **Modular Design**: Organized codebase for scalability and future enhancements.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Practical use of **Python** for automating repetitive tasks.
- Basics of file handling (`.py`, `.bat`) and program execution.
- Importance of user feedback in iterative software improvement.
- Conceptual understanding of ERP systems and their real-world applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Batch scripting (.bat)**
- **File I/O operations**
- **Command-line interface (CLI)**

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
├── attendance.py         # Staff attendance logging
├── delivery.py           # Delivery record management
├── invoice.py            # Invoice generation logic
├── main.py               # Entry point for the ERP system
├── data/                 # Folder containing logs and records
│   ├── attendance.txt
│   ├── delivery.txt
│   └── invoices.txt
├── run.bat               # Batch file to execute the program
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/inamansari-92/Class-project-ERP.git
   cd Class-project-ERP
   ```
2. Run the program using the batch file:
   ```bash
   run.bat
   ```
   Or execute `main.py` directly:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Integrate **AI modules** for predictive analytics and smart reporting.
- Deploy the system on the **cloud** for remote access across time zones.
- Add a **GUI interface** for improved usability.
- Implement **user authentication** and role-based access control.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
Thanks to the staff at A.T COMMODITIES for their valuable feedback during testing and refinement. This project was completed as part of a class assignment and continues to evolve with practical insights.
